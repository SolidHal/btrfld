Assembly Tips:

Must trim a very very slight amount off of the center pin on keyswitches over the body/thumbcluster rod

TODO: 

- pick location for promicro in base
  - might have to be on the right or left?
  - need to check dimensions
- ribbon cable retainers on baseplate
- make the body support have a slight pocket to fit the underside of keyswitches
- wiring slots on body/thumb cluster
  - pick out wire diameter
- slot in thumb cluster extension for ribbon cable
  - make this retain the ribbon cable?
- retainer for body/thumb cluster rod

nice to haves
- latch to keep folded?
- latches to retain body/thumb extensions in base?
