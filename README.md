Used this one https://www.amazon.com/Type-C-Breakout-Serial-Connector-Converter/dp/B09KC1SMGD/
wiring:
```
For most usages, you can just connect VBUS to your 5V input, GND to ground, and D+ and D- as you expect. You can monitor the CC and SBU pins to determine cable polarity, or send side-band data. Or leave them disconnected
```

A USB 2.0 USB C cable to cut up
USB C to Micro usb can be gotten pretty cheap


Assembly Tips:

Must trim a very very slight amount off of the center pin on keyswitches over the body/thumbcluster rod

Controller Location
 - center of left side of baseplate
 - along with battery
 - wires from right side route to left side
 
 
Body/ThumbCluster Pivot Rob
  - BodyThumbRod Cap gets glued on body end of rod
  - thumb cluster end of rod gets glued in place
  
Retain wire in thumb cluster with 2 dots of super glue

TODO: 
- redo wiring for bluemicro & to make wiring easier with controller position
- choose place for power switch by usb-c port, make it recessed
- ribbon cable retainers on baseplate

nice to haves
- latch to keep folded?
- latches to retain body/thumb extensions in base?

Attach trackpoint/ball or touchpad somewhere?
