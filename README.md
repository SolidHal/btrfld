Assembly Tips:

Must trim a very very slight amount off of the center pin on keyswitches over the body/thumbcluster rod

Controller Location
 - center of left side of baseplate
 - along with battery
 - wires from right side route to left side

TODO: 

- pick out usb-c extension
- choose place for usb-c extension port on left side
- choose place for power switch by usb-c port, make it recessed
- make the body support have a slight pocket to fit the underside of keyswitches
- wiring slots on body/thumb cluster
  - pick out wire diameter
- slot in thumb cluster extension for ribbon cable
  - make this retain the ribbon cable?
  - 6 of the ribbon cable wires is 7.6mm
- retainer for body/thumb cluster rod
- ribbon cable retainers on baseplate

nice to haves
- latch to keep folded?
- latches to retain body/thumb extensions in base?

BaseBodyAngle goes from 0 -> 32


Future: 
Attach trackpoint/ball or touchpad somewhere?
